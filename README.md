## Demo / Screenshots
Add a link or screenshots of your site here.

Example:

- Screenshot:
  - /assets/screenshots/home.png (add images to the repo and update path)

## Technologies
- HTML (100%)
- Optional: CSS, JavaScript — add as needed

## Installation & Local Preview
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Karan-Rajput-0019/Portfolio.git
2. Move into the project folder:
   cd Portfolio
3. Open index.html in your browser:
   - Double-click index.html, or
   - Run a simple static server, for example (Python):
     python3 -m http.server 8000
   - Then open http://localhost:8000

## Deployment
To publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Ensure your site entrypoint is index.html at the repository root or in the branch/folder you choose.
2. In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source branch (e.g., main) and folder (root).
3. Save — GitHub Pages will publish at the provided url (usually https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/).

## Customization
- Replace placeholder content in index.html with your name, bio, project items, and links.
- Add a CSS file (e.g., styles.css) and link it from index.html to style the site.
- Add images to an assets/ or images/ folder and reference them from HTML.
- To add new sections, copy the structure of existing sections and adapt.
